# CPM

CPM (CMake Project Maker) is a command-line tool designed to simplify the initial setup of C++ projects with robust CMake integration.  

Instead of relying on copy-pasted templates or clunky IDE-generated projects, CPM provides reusable and customizable templates that make it easy to create well-structured projects of any size. From single executables to large multi-component libraries, CPM helps developers get started quickly with consistent and maintainable CMake setups.  

## Goals

- Generate clean and scalable project structures  
- Provide reusable CMake templates for executables, libraries, and hybrid projects  
- Offer customization options for different project types and configurations  
- Reduce reliance on IDE-specific templates (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion)  
- Streamline the workflow with a lightweight command-line interface  

## Status

This project is in its early stages. Core functionality and usage examples will be added as development progresses.
